GtkSpell provides word-processor-style highlighting and replacement of misspelled words in a GtkTextView widget.
Right-clicking a misspelled word pops up a menu of suggested replacements.

You need to add the --enable-spell switch to your ./configure statement when
you build PHP-GTK 2 in order to enable this extension.

This extension can be used on Win32 however you will need the gtkspell library
.dll and a working aspell installation with the aspell bin directory in your $PATH
